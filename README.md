Ball Blast
I chose Ball Blast Game because we were previously given a similar task so i had an idea on how to brainstorm it.
In the last task, we were supoosed to make a similar game and i had many problems making it. Infact, i even gave up trying after staying up late and still not figuring out why my spawn items are not ranging in the specific x axis or why are my objects not colliding. Also, i couldnt understand how to split the balls but this time it was much easier.
The biggest hurdle that i faced was that i did save all the scripts but i forgot to save the game and my laptop blacked out the last minute and then i had to redo everything but that helped me review everything again and correct my mistakes.
Also i relized that i couldn't make animation myself 
Plus, i think i messed up the balls bounce.
overall i think it was a good experience. its the first time that i actually completed a game without having to stop midway.
